# Implementation of basic LCA in TypeScript.


See the [other repo](https://github.com/cppavel-sweng/LCA-Python) for the Python version.


* I had no prior experience with TypeScript before this module.

* I used jest and docker here. I set up the option to collect coverage too. The tests are parameterized.

* If you are running windows simply execute "run_tests.cmd".

* If you are running mac/linux copy commands from run_tests.cmd and execute them.

* The coverage is 100%.
